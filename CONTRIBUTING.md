# Finastra Design Kit
## Contribution

### Want to contribute? ü§ó
Want to share your designs and make it available for other designers and product teams?
You can contribute in two different ways:
* Design guidelines
* Design guidelines + design assets

## Explore available assets
* Search in [Design System website](https://design.fusionfabric.cloud/)
* Check the [content status](https://design.fusionfabric.cloud/status) page

## Install the fonts
* Download and install the required fonts from the [Design System foundations](https://github.com/Finastra/finastra-design-kit/tree/design/foundations) folder
**Note:**  Following the branding guidelines, we recommend using a licensed font (Futura).

## Use the design UI kits
**Foundations:** When building your component, always reuse the [foundations](https://github.com/Finastra/finastra-design-kit/tree/design/foundations) to guarantee consistency in colors, typography styles and most of the basic UI elements like buttons, text fields, etc.
**Components :** You will find also in the [components folder](https://github.com/Finastra/finastra-design-kit/tree/design/components) other Finastra specific components.

## Download the contribution templates
**contribution-template :** from the contribute folder, you can use [[Light] Contribution-Template](https://github.com/Finastra/finastra-design-kit/tree/contribute) to start your contribution.
This file comes with 2 artboards:
* ‚ÄúFinastra / Your contribution / Preview‚Äù where you can put a preview/cover for your contribution.
* "Finastra / Your contribution" where you will add :
-- option 1: a hifi image or a vector version of the contribution displayed at 100% size
-- option 2: a properly builded version of the contribution (like a component, a dashboard...) made with the foundations library

**contribution-template-doc :** from the contribute folder, you can use [[Light] Contribution-Template-Doc](https://github.com/Finastra/finastra-design-kit/tree/contribute) to start your contribution documentation.

Required content:
* A short description/overview of the component you want to share
* Tell what problem the component solves
* A preview screenshot of the component
* Explain the structure of the component



After review and validation we will provide it as part of these Design assets ;)
